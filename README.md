### Simple Example

Since HTTP runs over TCP, we can also use `go-tcp-proxy` as a primitive HTTP proxy:

```
$ go-tcp-proxy -r echo.jpillora.com:80
Proxying from localhost:9999 to echo.jpillora.com:80
```

Then test with `curl`:

```
$ curl -H 'Host: echo.jpillora.com' localhost:9999/foo
{
  "method": "GET",
  "url": "/foo"
  ...
}
```

### Match Example

```
$ go-tcp-proxy -r echo.jpillora.com:80 -match 'Host: (.+)'
Proxying from localhost:9999 to echo.jpillora.com:80
Matching Host: (.+)

#run curl again...

Connection #001 Match #1: Host: echo.jpillora.com
```

### Replace Example

```
$ go-tcp-proxy -r echo.jpillora.com:80 -replace '"ip": "([^"]+)"~"ip": "REDACTED"'
Proxying from localhost:9999 to echo.jpillora.com:80
Replacing "ip": "([^"]+)" with "ip": "REDACTED"
```

```
#run curl again...
{
  "ip": "REDACTED",
  ...
```
